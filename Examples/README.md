## 🚀 How to Generate Your Own Reports

### Using the MCP Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the MCP server
node build/index.js

# Then use MCP client tools to call:
# - analyze_codebase
# - find_security_vulnerabilities
# - assess_code_quality
```

### Direct Engine Usage
```javascript
import { CodeAnalysisEngine } from './build/index.js';

const engine = new CodeAnalysisEngine('./path/to/your/codebase');
const result = await engine.analyzeCodebase(['**/*.{js,py,cpp,ts}']);
```

## 📈 Report Generation Process

1. **File Discovery**: Scans specified directories for supported file types
2. **Language Detection**: Identifies programming language by file extension
3. **Entity Extraction**: Parses code to find classes, functions, variables
4. **Relationship Analysis**: Maps interactions between code components
5. **Security Scanning**: Detects common vulnerability patterns
6. **Quality Assessment**: Calculates complexity and maintainability metrics
7. **Report Generation**: Creates JSON and HTML reports in timestamped directories

## 🔧 Customization Options

- **File Patterns**: Specify which file types to include/exclude
- **Security Filters**: Focus on specific vulnerability types or severity levels
- **Quality Thresholds**: Customize complexity and quality thresholds
- **Output Location**: Configure where reports are saved

## 📊 Interpreting Results

### Security Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Immediate security risks (SQL injection, secret exposure)
- **High**: Significant security concerns (XSS, unsafe deserialization)
